To switch between different examples in your Streamlit app where the content is loaded from different text files within the same folder, you can use a select box to allow the user to choose the example they want to display.

```python
import streamlit as st
import os

# Assuming your text files are in the 'examples' folder
examples_folder = 'examples'

# Get a list of text files
example_files = [f for f in os.listdir(examples_folder) if f.endswith('.txt')]

# Function to read file content
def get_file_content(filename):
    with open(os.path.join(examples_folder, filename), 'r') as file:
        return file.read()

# Selection box for the user to choose an example
selected_file = st.selectbox('Choose an example', example_files)

# Display the content of the selected file in a text_area
file_content = get_file_content(selected_file)
st.text_area('File content', file_content, height=300)
```
